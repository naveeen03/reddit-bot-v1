### What is Reddit?

Reddit is an American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Registered members submit content to the site such as links, text posts, images, and videos, which are then voted up or down by other members.

- Go to [Reddit Prefs](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) and create a bot with account created above
- In above step, `Client ID`, `Access Token` are created, save 'em, we are going to use 'em in next steps
